# Access reviews and penetration testing

Placeholder for documenting where access review and penetration test records are kept, and how remediation is tracked.

## Access reviews

- **Purpose:** Periodic review of who has access to production systems and sensitive data (e.g. DB, admin accounts, API keys).
- **Recommendation:** Define frequency (e.g. quarterly) and owner in [security-policy.md](security-policy.md).
- **Records:** Document where access review evidence is stored (e.g. spreadsheet, ticketing system, governance folder). Example columns:
  - Review date
  - Scope (e.g. production DB, admin users, API keys)
  - Reviewer
  - Findings (e.g. access revoked, no change)
  - Next review date

## Penetration testing

- **Purpose:** Validate security controls and identify vulnerabilities.
- **Recommendation:** Schedule tests after major changes or at least periodically (e.g. annually); scope as appropriate (API, auth, internal endpoints).
- **Records:** Document where pen test reports and results are stored (confidential; restrict access).
- **Remediation:** Track findings and remediation (e.g. in a register or issue tracker). Example columns:
  - Finding ID
  - Description
  - Severity
  - Remediation status (open / in progress / closed)
  - Closure date / notes

*Update this document with actual locations and owners once established.*
