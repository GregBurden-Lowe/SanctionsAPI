# Breach log and procedure

Procedure for recording and reporting personal data breaches, including ICO notification within 72 hours where required.

## 1. When to log a breach

Log any incident that involves or may involve:

- Unauthorised access to, or disclosure of, personal data
- Loss or alteration of personal data
- Unavailability of personal data (e.g. ransomware, prolonged outage affecting data access)

## 2. Breach log (template)

Keep a register of incidents. Example columns:

| Ref | Date discovered | Description | Data affected | Risk to individuals | ICO notified? (Y/N + date) | Individuals informed? | Outcome / closure |
|-----|-----------------|-------------|---------------|---------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| 001 | YYYY-MM-DD      | [Brief description] | [e.g. user emails, screened names] | Low / Medium / High | Y – YYYY-MM-DD | Y/N | [Summary] |
| …   | …               | …           | …             | …                   | …                          | …                      | …                 |

*Store the log in a secure location (e.g. confidential drive or governance system); restrict access.*

## 3. Procedure

1. **Discover / report**  
   Anyone who becomes aware of a possible breach should report it immediately to the incident owner or Data Protection Lead (see [incident response runbook](runbooks/incident-response.md)).

2. **Triage and contain**  
   Follow the [incident response runbook](runbooks/incident-response.md): confirm breach, contain risk, assign owner.

3. **Assess**  
   - Is the breach likely to result in a **risk to the rights and freedoms** of individuals?  
   - If **yes** → notifiable to ICO (and possibly to individuals).

4. **Notify ICO**  
   - **Deadline:** Within **72 hours** of becoming aware of the breach (UK GDPR Article 33).  
   - **Method:** [ICO breach reporting](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/personal-data-breaches/personal-data-breaches-a-guide/reporting-a-breach/).  
   - If you cannot provide full details within 72 hours, you may provide information in phases; document the reason for delay.

5. **Notify individuals**  
   If the breach is likely to result in **high risk** to individuals, inform them without undue delay (Article 34). Document whether and when they were informed.

6. **Record**  
   Enter the incident in the breach log (section 2) and retain evidence of decisions and notifications for accountability.
