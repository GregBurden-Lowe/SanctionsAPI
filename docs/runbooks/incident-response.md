# Incident response runbook

Use this runbook for security or data incidents (including suspected personal data breaches). Adjust roles and contacts for your organisation.

## 1. Triage

- **Confirm** whether a personal data breach or security incident has occurred (e.g. unauthorised access, loss, alteration, or disclosure of personal data).
- **Contain** immediate risk where possible (e.g. revoke access, isolate affected systems, preserve evidence).
- **Assign** an incident owner and note the time of discovery.

## 2. Assess severity and breach reporting

- **Personal data breach:** If the incident is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, the UK GDPR requires notification.
- **ICO notification:** You must notify the ICO of a notifiable breach **within 72 hours** of becoming aware of it, unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to individuals.  
  Guidance: [ICO – When do we need to notify the ICO?](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/personal-data-breaches/personal-data-breaches-a-guide/when-do-we-need-to-notify-the-ico/)
- **Individuals:** If the breach is likely to result in a high risk to individuals, you must also inform those individuals without undue delay (ICO guidance applies).
- **Document** the breach and your assessment in the [breach log / procedure](../breach-log-procedure.md).

## 3. Internal escalation

- Escalate to the designated **Data Protection Lead** or equivalent.
- Notify **senior management** for serious or notifiable breaches.
- Involve **IT / security** for containment and evidence preservation.
- Retain **records** of the breach, decisions, and any notifications (ICO and individuals) for accountability.

## 4. Post-incident

- **Remediate** root cause and update controls where needed.
- **Review** and update this runbook and related procedures if gaps are found.
- **Log** the incident and outcome in the breach log.
